[^note]: As an important side note: It's essential to acknowledge that any information, especially related to sensitive topics like politics, conflict, or war, can potentially contain bias. It is crucial to approach this data carefully. 
  The situation is undeniably saddening for any human, and it's important to maintain objectivity and sensitivity when interacting with such data.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to gain practical experience in the development and deployment process with a professional approach, guided by a mentor ([Omar Moreno](https://github.com/Arcont01)). 

Learning objectives:
1. Utilizing GitHub and Docker for collaborative development.
2. Proficiency in Python and Django framework for backend development.
3. Database (SQL) management and migration.
4. Creating APIs with a focus on authentication.
5. Deployment on a server using Docker.

## Resources
To achieve these objectives, the project will make use of the following resources and technologies:

- GitHub
- Docker
- Python (latest):
  - Pyenv for version control
  - Pandas for data
  - Jupyter for data
  - Django for back-end
  - Streamlit for front-end
- HTML
- CSS
- ...

## TODO:
- Define SQL dialect
- Create venv
- Explore data:
  - Data types
  - Insights
  - Variables correlation
- Automation of data updating.
- Possible ML Approach for predicting future casualties.
- Possible SQL.
